# GRY_for_UK_Gilts

In this short project I calculated the Gross Redemption Yiled for the UK gilts. 

For the calculation, this is what needs to be done: 

HPR = Nominal price - Purchased Price / Purchased Price (in %)

HPR (Holding Period of Return)

Annualised gain/loss = HPR / Years to maturity

GRY = Flat Yield +- Annualised gain/loss.
